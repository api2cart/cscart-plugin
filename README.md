# Cs-cart plugin
Our connector plugins trigger a push-a-button connection and thus eliminate the inconvenience of sharing logins, passwords, and all kinds of keys.


Cs-Cart Plugin Installation

1) After you unzip the plugin archive, you will find 3 folders:

2) Upload these folders to the website root folder (there you will find folders with the same names) and find the plugin displayed in the CS-Cart admin panel.
3) Go to the admin panel, find Add-ons, and choose Manage add-ons in the drop-down menu.
4) Go to the Browse all available addons tab and press the Install button. 
5) Go to the Installed addons tab, find the plugin, and go to the plugin page. Once there, do not forget to download the bridge.

Service enhancement takes research, data collection, and analysis. That is why we added a snipped of tracking code into our plugins. It gets activated after the connector has been installed. It does not track any personal data and serves as a statistics means only.
